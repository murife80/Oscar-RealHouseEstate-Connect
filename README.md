Real House Estate Agent Connect

Description
Real House Estate Agent Connect is a simple web application that allows users to search for real estate agents based on their county. The platform allows agents to register with their details (name, email, phone, and county), and users can search for agents in specific counties. The application also provides About Us and Reach Us pages to provide users with more information and contact details.
The project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with in-memory storage) to allow users to interact with registered agents and to register new agents.
